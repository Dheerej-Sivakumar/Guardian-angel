# Guardian-angel
Guardian Angel is a personalized health companion app prototype built in Python that reminds users to hydrate, move, breathe, and journal. Instead of nagging, it offers gentle, playful popups with animations. A supportive self-care companion that makes wellness fun. A smartwatch tracks your heart, while Guardian Angel touches it.
